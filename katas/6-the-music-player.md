# 6. The music player
Now that we can produce sounds at different notes and durations, it is time we make an interface that makes it even easier to play music.

## Tasks
1. Extend the note range you created in the earlier tasks to include a wide enough range of notes to your liking
2. Create a `musicplayer` module and a music player struct containing at least two sinks representing two different instruments (or tracks).
3. Implement functionality for adding notes, their duration, and their instrument to the music player. Different instruments should play at the same time while the same instrument should play sequentially.
4. Implement a `play` function on the music player that plays through all the sounds that have been added to it.
