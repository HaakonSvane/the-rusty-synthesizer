## ðŸ“š Facts ðŸ“š

> #### Compiled languages
> Contrary to many popular programming languages commonly used today, Rust is a compiled langauage with no interpreter. This means all code is built up-front to machine code.

> #### Cargo
> We interact with our Rust project using `cargo`, the package manager and build-tool for Rust. If you are familiar with JavaScript, think of `cargo` as `npm`: a tool both for executing your code and for managing your project's external dependencies.
