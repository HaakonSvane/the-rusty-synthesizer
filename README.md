# Code Social - The Rusty Synthesizer ðŸŽ¹

## Prerequisites
Before we begin coding, rust has to be installed on your machine. Follow the official [Rust docs](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) for information on how to download Rust through Rustup, the most common way of installing Rust. If you want to view (or play around with) the presentation for the code social, you'll need node on your machine. `cd` into the `presentation` directory and `npm install` + `npm run dev` to run the presentation locally.

## Katas
The challenges you will be solving involve both learning a thing or two about music _and_ Rust. All of these learning challanges are found in the `katas` directory. They are numbered incrementally. If you finish all your katas in time, and you still want to learn more, there are additional challanges labelled by an `X` that you can look into. These aim at visiting other aspects of either music or rust.

Each challange includes very little information about _how_ to solve the problems. This Code Social is designed to not just have you learn the concepts, but also were to find information about them. Using LLM's, StackOverflow, documentation or YouTube tutorials are encouraged, but please take it easy on LLM's for learning a language for the first time. Make sure you actually understand what it suggests to you and force yourself to actually type some code on your own as well.


## Resources
If you or your partner ever find yourselves stuck, the rust handbook is an excellent resource that contains many great examples for you to read through:
