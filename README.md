# Code Social - The Rusty Synthesizer ðŸŽ¹

## Prerequisites
Before we begin coding, rust has to be installed on your machine. You can also open this repository in a dev container which comes with everything you need pre-configured. Follow the official [Rust docs](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) for information on how to download Rust through Rustup, the most common way of installing Rust.

## Katas
The challenges you will be solving involve both learning a thing or two about sound and Rust. They may be completed in any order, but aim at teaching you both. Head into the katas directory for all the learning challanges. They are numbered in a way that you can follow them incrementally if you want to cover everything from the start, but starting at any number is also fine. Think of it like wathiching Friends.


## Resources
If you or your parner find yourself stuck, here are a couple of resources you can use to get back on track:

- __[The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)__
> The official online book for learning everything about Rust. Highly reccomended!
