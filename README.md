# Code Social - The Rusty Synthesizer ðŸŽ¹

## Prerequisites
Before we begin coding, rust has to be installed on your machine. You can also open this repository in a dev container which comes with everything you need pre-configured. Follow the official [Rust docs](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) for information on how to download Rust through Rustup, the most common way of installing Rust.

## Katas
The challenges you will be solving involve both learning a thing or two about sound _and_ Rust, but the first ones are mainly aimed at getting your hands dirty with the latter. All of these learning challanges are found in the `katas` directory. They are numbered in a way so that you can follow them incrementally if you want to cover everything from the start, but starting at any number is also fine. If you skip too far ahead, you _might_ risk missing some information required from an earlier challange. No harm in skimming through the earlier onces in that case! Think of it like watching Friends. 

Each challange includes very little information about _how_ to solve problems. This Code Social is designed to not just have you learn the concepts, but also were to find information about them. Using LLM's, StackOverflow, documentation or YouTube tutorials are encouraged!


## Resources
If you or your parner find yourself stuck, here are a couple of resources you can use to get back on track:

- __[The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)__
> The official online book for learning everything about Rust. Highly reccomended!
